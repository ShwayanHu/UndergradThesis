# UndergradThesis

This repository contains code for my undergraduate thesis. Since my undergraduate thesis is in Chinese, the comment and name of variables, etc. may not be friendly to native speakers. And since the paper is further modified and is current under publication review process, I may not be able to share the whole code with you. 

However, I believe the code included are enough for demonstrating my proficiency with python for statistical analysis.
